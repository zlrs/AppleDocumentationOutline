# Apple Documentation Outline Helper
Provide content outline for [Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/).

Apple developers read [Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/) frequently in their daily work. Although the documentation is well written, it doesn't provide a content outline that help developers get the structure of the articles. 

This extension improves the reading experience of [Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/) by adding an outline section on the right column of the page.
